## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, and Ohm Swastiastu!

I am a Masterâ€™s student in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae), working under the supervision of [Dr. Fajri Koto](https://www.fajrikoto.com/home) and [Prof. Thamar Solorio](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/thamar-solorio/). My research focuses on Multilingual NLP, Low-resource Languages, and Linguistic Resource.

I am particularly interested in expanding NLP capabilities for low-resource languages and improving multilingual models, with a strong focus on Indonesian and regional languages like Javanese and Sundanese. My work involves building linguistic resources, enhancing evaluation benchmarks, and investigating challenges like code-switching in multilingual contexts.

If youâ€™re interested in collaborating or discussing low-resource NLP, feel free to get in touch! You can reach me via email at <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">salsabila dot pranida at mbzuai.ac.ae</span>.
