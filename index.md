## 👋 Hello, and Ohm Swastiastu!

I am a Master’s student in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae), working under the supervision of [Dr. Fajri Koto](https://www.fajrikoto.com/home) and [Prof. Thamar Solorio](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/thamar-solorio/). My research lies at the intersection of Computational Social Science and NLP, focusing on dialogue systems, multilingual and dialect processing, resource development, and evaluation, as well as speech technologies.

I primarily work on **Indonesian and its local languages and dialects**, though I’m always eager to explore other linguistic and cultural contexts. I’m particularly interested in understanding how language and dialect variation reflect social and cultural nuances, as well as in modeling **code-switching and code-mixing** to better capture the dynamics of multilingual communication.

If you’re interested in collaborating or discussing low-resource NLP, feel free to get in touch! You can reach me via email at <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">salsabila dot pranida at mbzuai.ac.ae</span>.
